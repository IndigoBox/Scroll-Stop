			To get started with Scroll Stop, open the options and enter a URL that <br>
			you would like Scroll Stop to be active on. You do not need to enter an <br>
			exact URL in these fields, Scroll Stop will check to see if the URL <br>
			contains the string you entered. For instance, typing "facebook" in the <br>
			URL field will match "www.facebook.com", as well as other URLs that <br>
			contain "facebook" in them.
		</p>
		<p>
			Then, after you have chosen a URL or a match parameter, type in a value,<br>
			in pixels, for how far you want Scroll Stop to let you scroll before <br>
			stopping you.
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, you can specify the behavior Scroll Stop should take when you <br>
			reach your scroll limit. You can choose between closing the tab, removing <br>
			the contents of the tab, or redirecting to a different url.
